# Tutor MVP: implementation map

This is the builders' shared map for the MVP on branch `tutor/mvp`. It says who owns which files,
and it pins down every contract between them. [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) says what to build and
[`CHANGELOG-from-design.md`](CHANGELOG-from-design.md) overrides it where they differ. The UX is
[`mockups.html`](mockups.html), round 2, with these picks: sidebar **1B** (now one course outline
tree), lesson **2A** (now the lesson card leading the coach thread in BB's own thread view), coach
moments **3A**, and example states **6B** (now also the Rule card). Choice buttons (3B) are not
built. Words follow [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md), in the code as in the prose; the course repo's
`docs/iterations/`, `spec/ITERATION`, PROGRESS.yaml's `iteration` key and the
`tutor_*_iteration` tools keep the course's own word.

The plugin is `src/tutor/plugin` (npm `bb-plugin-tutor`, plugin id `tutor`). It targets bb-app
0.43.4 and pins `@get-bb/plugin-sdk` to exactly 0.5.9.

## Ownership

Four builders work in parallel. Each one writes only inside their own paths. Everything else is
read-only to them. If a contract below has to change, stop and report it; don't edit someone
else's file.

| Path (under `src/tutor/plugin/` unless absolute) | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, `components.json` | skeleton | Frozen. Every runtime dependency is already installed (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)). |
| `shared/**` | skeleton | Read only. The contracts. |
| `components/`, `lib/`, `hooks/` | skeleton | Vendored BB UI (shadcn model). The frontend may *use* these, and may add new files under `components/ui/`. |
| `README.md`, `PLUGIN_OVERVIEW.md` | skeleton | Builders can suggest changes in their report. |
| `server/course/**` | **CONTENT** | Implements `CourseSource`. Also owns Lesson 0's content. |
| `server.ts`, `server/progress/**`, `server/coach/**`, `server/rpc/**`, `test/**` (plugin-level integration tests), `skills/tutor/SKILL.md` | **BACKEND** | Replaces the stub `server.ts`. |
| `app.tsx`, `app/**` (including `paper.css` and `fonts/`) | **FRONTEND** | Replaces the stub `app.tsx`. Component CSS goes in `app/styles/`. |
| `src/tutor/{devcontainer-feature.json,install.sh,bin/,README.md,NOTES.md}`, `test/tutor/**` (repo root), `.devcontainer/tutor/**`, `test/tutor/fixtures/scripted-provider/` | **FEATURE** | The feature, its tests, the codespace entry point, and the end-to-end fixture. |

Everyone may read the course repo at `work/tutorial`, but must not modify it. The containerised BB
harness is `scripts/tutor-dev/`. Keep its README's rules, and don't change the scripts; ask
instead.

## Rules for everyone

- **Quality bar:** TypeScript strict (plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), small focused modules, no
  dead code, and comments only where something isn't obvious.
- **Tests:** unit tests for all logic, run with `node --test`. Put them next to the code as
  `*.test.ts`. `npm test` picks up `shared/**`, `server/**`, `app/**` and `test/**`.
- **Imports:** relative imports carry their extension (`../shared/model.ts`), so node can run the
  sources directly. The `@/…` alias only works in bundled `.tsx`. Type-only imports use
  `import type`; `verbatimModuleSyntax` enforces this. Only erasable TypeScript is allowed: no
  enums, namespaces or parameter properties.
- **Node can't run `.tsx`.** Frontend logic goes in plain `.ts` modules (view models, formatters,
  routing) with tests. Keep the `.tsx` components thin. Nothing that a node test imports may
  import `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/app` or React at runtime.
- **Before you report:** `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` and `bb plugin build .` must
  all pass. Build inside the harness: `TUTOR_DEV_CWD=$PWD/src/tutor/plugin
  scripts/tutor-dev/bb.sh plugin build $PWD/src/tutor/plugin`. For live checks, run
  `scripts/tutor-dev/install-plugin.sh src/tutor/plugin` and then `node scripts/tutor-dev/shot.mjs …`.
- **Hard rules** (from the brief): never touch the host BB at 127.0.0.1:38886, never copy provider
  credentials, never commit, and only write inside `work/` and `$TMPDIR`.

## Dependencies

The skeleton owns these, and they are all installed. Don't add any.

## Contracts

### Keys, slugs and hashes (CONTENT produces, everyone consumes)

- **Rule key:** `<feature-file-slug>/<rule-slug>`. **Example key:**
  `<feature-file-slug>/<rule-slug>/<example-slug>`. The feature-file slug is the file's basename
  without `.feature`, slugified. Rule and Example slugs are their names, slugified, then made unique
  among siblings in file order with `uniqueSlugs` (`-2`, `-3`, …). Always use the helpers in
  `shared/keys.ts`; never hand-roll a key.
- Examples directly under a Feature, outside any Rule, are grouped into a synthetic Rule. Its slug
  is `LOOSE_EXAMPLES_RULE_SLUG` (`general`), its name is the Feature's name, and it comes first.
- A Scenario Outline is one Example. It is not expanded.
- **Example text hash:** `sha256:` followed by the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the UTF-8 text built
  like this, with lines joined by `\n`:
  1. the Example's name;
  2. for each step, `<keyword> <text>`, keyword as written (`Given`, `And`, …);
  3. for a docstring, a line `"""<mediaType or empty>`, then its content lines, then `"""`;
  4. for a data table, each row as its cells joined by ` | `.

  Every line has its whitespace runs collapsed to one space and is then trimmed. Tags, the
  description, line numbers and Background steps are left out. So rewording a step changes the
  hash, and re-indenting or moving the Example doesn't.
- **New and reworded** Examples: each lesson is compared with the previous lesson in course order, as
  documented on `changeSchema`. Everything in Lesson 0 and in the first real lesson is `new`.
- **`suggestedRuleOrder`:** every Rule key exactly once. Rules that are not `unchanged` come
  first, then the rest, each group in file order. Files are sorted by path.
- **`factoryDiff`:** the FACTORY.md line diff against the previous non-builtin lesson. It is
  `null` for Lesson 0 and for the first real lesson.
- **`dek`:** the first prose paragraph of README.md, skipping the `#` title and any italic
  *Set after…* line.

### Course loading (CONTENT implements `CourseSource`)

`createCourseSource(): CourseSource` is exported from `server/course/index.ts`. The backend
imports only that file. `loadCourse(coursePath)` works as follows:

1. **`course.yaml`**, when present, has the shape given in DESIGN.md: `id`, `title`, optional
   `description`, `coach`, optional `lexicon`, and `lessons[]` with `{ id, title, set, dir }`.
2. **Otherwise the ledger fallback.** Parse the table in `docs/iterations/README.md`: the
   `Iteration` column is the id, the `Spec` link text is the title and its target's directory is
   `dir`, and `Set after` is `set`. Then `id` is `slugify(basename(coursePath))`, `title` is the
   course README's first `#` heading (or the id), `description` is null, `coach` is
   `.agents/coach-me.md` if it exists, and `lexicon` is `docs/lexicon.yaml` if it exists.
3. **Lesson 0** ("Using your tutor", id `000`, set `Start here`, `builtin: true`) comes first. Its
   content lives in `server/course/builtin/`: a `course.yaml` naming `lesson-0/`, which holds
   `README.md`, `features/*.feature` and a short `FACTORY.md`. Find its directory from `import.meta.url`, not the working directory. Its
   Examples teach the interface, for example "When you ask a side question about the Rule in
   focus, then a side chat opens in the "Side chat" tab beside your coach thread".
4. **Lexicon:** each YAML key becomes `{ id, term, definition }`. A missing lexicon gives `[]`.
5. **Errors:** throw `CourseLoadError` with a message the student can read, naming the file and line
   where there is one.

Test against small fixture courses under `server/course/fixtures/`. Gate an integration test on
the real tutorial repo behind `TUTOR_TEST_COURSE=/path/to/tutorial`, and skip it when that is unset.

### Where things are (FEATURE writes, BACKEND reads)

- **Course path** is resolved in this order: the `coursePath` setting, then the
  `TUTOR_COURSE_PATH` env var, then `course` in `/usr/local/etc/tutor/config.json`, then
  `/workspaces/tutorial`.
- **Factory hint:** the `TUTOR_FACTORY_PATH` env var, then `factory` in the config file. It is used
  only to pre-select a candidate project whose default local source path matches.
- **The factory project** is always a BB project id, stored in the `factoryProject` setting (`type:
  "project"`), which `confirmFactory` writes with `settings.experimental_set`. The plugin never
  creates projects. When none is set, the factory project is `unset`; one that resolves is
  `found`. A stored id whose project, or whose local source, has gone is `missing`.
- **The feature's `install.sh`** writes the config file as JSON
  `{ "course": "…", "factory": "…", "dataDir": "…" }`, leaving out any key whose option is empty.
  `dataDir` is the bb Feature's BB state directory (or `$_REMOTE_USER_HOME/.bb` when that option is
  empty), the last fallback for the heartbeat below. It also path-installs the plugin in a
  `postStartCommand` that runs after `bb-feature-autostart`, from a user-owned copy at
  `<dataDir>/.tutor-feature/plugin-<digest>` (BB rebuilds `dist/` on every path install, so the
  root-owned image copy cannot be installed directly), and skips the install when the plugin is
  already installed from that path. If BB exposes a way to select the course outline under
  Settings → Appearance → Sidebar, the feature does that too. Otherwise the first-run page tells the
  student how.

- **Activity heartbeat (shared with the feature's keep-alive).** `<BB data dir>/.tutor-feature/activity`
  (`ACTIVITY_FILE`) holds one line, an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp of the last time the student was
  actively using BB. The plugin's `heartbeat` RPC writes it atomically, creating the directory
  0700, at most every 30 s; the data dir is `bb.server.experimental_dataDir`, then `BB_DATA_DIR`,
  then `dataDir` in the config file. The app-wide content script `activity` (`app/activity.ts`)
  calls it at most every 45 s while the page is visible and the student interacted in the last
  60 s. `/usr/local/bin/tutor-keepalive`, run by `.devcontainer/tutor`'s `postAttachCommand`,
  treats a stamp under 120 s old as active and prints a line to its terminal every 30 s.
- **Once per BB state directory, the feature's start-up hook** also switches off the plugins in its
  `disablePlugins` option (recorded per id in `.tutor-feature/plugins-disabled`, so a student can
  turn one back on) and selects the `theme` option (`plugin:tutor:paper`) while BB's default theme
  is active (`.tutor-feature/theme-selected`).

### Student state (BACKEND implements `ProgressStore` in `server/progress/`)

- **`spec/ITERATION`** is one line, `NNN WIP` or `NNN Done`. It is canonical (decision 1) and is
  never written for Lesson 0.
- **`spec/PROGRESS.yaml`** follows `progressFileSchema`. It extends the design with four additive
  fields: `adopted` (when the iteration was adopted), `summary` (the coach's text from
  `tutor_complete_iteration`), per Example `carriedFrom`, and `history`: on adopt, the previous
  lesson's `adopted`, `summary` and Example entries (without `evidence`) are kept under its id, so
  done lessons' start and completion pages stay truthful. Write it with the ids quoted
  (`iteration: "003"`), so YAML never reads them as numbers. Keep a stable key order: `iteration`,
  `focus`, `adopted`, `summary`, `examples`, `history`. Sort `examples` by key and `history` by id.
  Write it atomically. Only the coach tools write it.
- **Reading never throws.** Malformed content goes into `StudentState.problems`, with the part that
  couldn't be read set to null.
- **Stale progress:** when `progress.iteration` differs from the current lesson (see
  `resolveCurrent`), treat the progress map as `{}` for that lesson. Read-side views of a done
  lesson use its `history` entry instead.
- **Current lesson:** `resolveCurrent` and `lessonStatus` in `shared/derive.ts` decide it. The
  backend must not reimplement them. Lesson 0 is under way when PROGRESS.yaml says `"000"`, and it
  is Done once all of its Examples are passing or skipped. With no state at all, the student is on
  Lesson 0 and `not-started`.
- **Carry-over on adopt:** every Example of the new lesson whose hash matches a **passing** entry
  in the previous PROGRESS.yaml, under any key, starts as `passing`. It keeps that entry's
  `evidence` and `at`, and gets `carriedFrom: <entry.carriedFrom ?? previous iteration>`. Every
  other Example has no entry, which means pending. The focus becomes the first entry of
  `suggestedRuleOrder`.
- The backend re-reads state on `thread.idle` for Tutor threads and on every RPC call. When the
  state changes, it publishes `REALTIME_CHANNELS.stateChanged` with a `StateChangedSignal`.

### Coach threads and tools (BACKEND, `server/coach/`)

- **Coach thread per lesson:** `bb.sdk.threads.spawn({ projectId: <factory project>, environment: { type:
  "host", hostId: <factory source's host>, workspace: { type: "unmanaged", path: <factory root> } },
  title: coachThreadTitle(id), pluginMetadata: { course, lesson, role: "coach" }, prompt })`. The
  unmanaged workspace guarantees the coach edits the folder Tutor reads, even when the project
  defaults to worktrees. Find it again with `threads.list({ originPluginId: bb.pluginId })` filtered
  by metadata. If there are several, the newest one that isn't archived wins.
- **Side chats** (`server/coach/side-chats.ts`): what BB's built-in side-chat plugin does.
  `bb.sdk.threads.fork({ sourceThreadId: <coach>, lifecycleOwnerThreadId: <coach>, visibility:
  "hidden", title, pluginMetadata: { course, lesson, role: "sideChat", ruleKey? }, agentContextSeed:
  [{ type: "text", text, mentions: [], visibility: "agent-only" }] })`, a seed-only fork that stays
  idle until the student writes in it and reuses the coach's environment. Then the tab BB writes for
  "Reply in side chat", appended with `threads.tabs.update` (retried up to 3 times on
  `thread_tabs_conflict`): `{ id: "plugin-panel:" + encodeURIComponent("side-chat:side-chat:" +
  paramsJson) + ":none", kind: "plugin-panel", pluginId: "side-chat", actionId: "side-chat", title:
  "Side chat", paramsJson: { threadId, sourceThreadId, sourceMessageText, sourceSeqEnd: null } }`.
  A plugin cannot select another plugin's tab, so the frontend points to it with a toast. A
  provider that cannot fork gets a readable error; there is no fallback. The side chats of a coach
  thread are its live hidden forks (`threads.list({ sourceThreadId, includeHidden: true })`), BB's
  own included. Side threads spawned before side chats (children, `parentThreadId`) still list.
- **A fork is never the coach thread.** A thread's role comes from its structure (`threadRole`): a
  fork or a child is `sideChat`, whatever its metadata says, and a hidden thread that forks nothing is
  not listed.
- **Reached Rules:** `tutor_focus_rule` adds the Rule to the coach thread's `reachedRules` metadata
  (lenient read, at most 500). The coach puts the Rule card at the top of the message that turns to
  the Rule, so these are the Rules with a section to jump to. They live on the coach thread, not in
  `PROGRESS.yaml`, because a section exists only in that thread: a new coach thread (or coaching
  outside BB) has none, and carry-over needs nothing.
- **Metadata is untrusted.** It is fine for listing threads and filling the outline, and for knowing
  which lesson a verified coach thread coaches (below). It must never decide whether a thread is
  Tutor's.
- **`configure`** is synchronous. It offers `ALL_TOOL_NAMES` and `SKILL_ID` when
  `ctx.origin.pluginId === bb.pluginId`, and to a fork whose `sourceThreadId` is a coach thread Tutor
  has seen (`server/coach/coach-registry.ts`, filled by listings and spawns, warmed at start).
- **Every `execute()`** re-checks the calling thread with BB (`server/coach/auth.ts`,
  `coachThreadOf`): a Tutor coach thread; a hidden fork of one (Tutor's side chat, or BB's, which
  counts as a side chat of that lesson without a Rule); or a child Tutor spawned under one. It
  returns `{ content: [{ type: "text", text }], isError: true }` for anything else, a visible fork
  or a fork of a side chat included. Only the coach thread itself moves the focus. The caller's
  lesson is the one its coach thread's Tutor metadata names (Tutor wrote it at spawn; side chats
  inherit it, and a fork's own metadata is never read for it). `tutor_focus_rule`,
  `tutor_mark_example` and `tutor_complete_iteration` refuse unless that is the current lesson;
  `tutor_adopt_iteration` adopts only the caller's lesson; `tutor_side_chat` files the side chat
  under the caller's lesson; `tutor_status` names the caller's lesson and says when it isn't the
  current one. The current lesson and the factory root are re-derived from the factory project and
  the repo. Tool output stays bounded: a few KB.
- **Tools** use the parameter schemas in `shared/tools.ts`:

  | Tool | Does | Returns |
  |---|---|---|
  | `tutor_status` | Current lesson, focus, and each Rule's Examples with key, status and name | Compact text the coach can act on, listing keys |
  | `tutor_focus_rule` | Sets `focus` and records the Rule as reached. Coach thread only; side chats get `isError` | The Rule card, a `formatProgressCard({ kind: "focus", … })` line to put at the top of the next message |
  | `tutor_mark_example` | Sets one Example's status; `evidence` is required for passing and `note` for not-yet (the schema enforces this) | The matching `::tutor-progress` line: `rule-passing` when the Rule just went all-green, otherwise `example-passing` or `not-yet` |
  | `tutor_adopt_iteration` | Only the caller's own lesson, and only the lesson after a Done one, or the first. Copies README.md, FACTORY.md and features/ into `spec/` exactly, copies `spec.md` into `seeds/` as coach-me does, writes ITERATION `NNN WIP` and a fresh PROGRESS.yaml with carry-over. Lesson 0 writes only PROGRESS.yaml. **Does not commit**: the coach commits, following coach-me | Summary, and the `git show --stat` hint |
  | `tutor_complete_iteration` | Writes ITERATION `NNN Done` and PROGRESS `summary`. Lesson 0 instead requires every Example to be passing or skipped | A `lesson-complete` card line |
  | `tutor_side_chat` | Forks a side chat of the coach thread, with the question as its seed, and adds its tab (see above) | The new side chat's id, and where the student finds it |

- **Dispatch guard:** an `experimental_hooks` `message.dispatch` handler queues, with a reason, the
  turn of any Tutor thread (side chats included, BB's own too) whose project has another one still
  running.
- **Prompts:** the coach thread's first prompt names the lesson, tells the coach to follow the
  `tutor` skill and carries the lesson card line (`::tutor-lesson{lesson="NNN"}`) for its first
  reply to open with. For `startNextLesson`, it also tells the coach to call
  `tutor_adopt_iteration` first.
- **The skill** (`skills/tutor/SKILL.md`) explains the BB-specific behaviour: the tools, the
  evidence rules, the lesson card and Rule cards, when to emit `::tutor-progress` and
  `::term{id=…}` (lexicon ids only), side chats, and that only the coach thread moves the focus.
  It tells the coach to follow the course's `coach` file as its coaching method, and that "jfdi"
  remains a phrase the student types.

### RPC (BACKEND serves `server/rpc/`, FRONTEND calls)

`shared/rpc.ts` is the contract. It includes the semantics of each method, and every payload shape
is a zod schema. The methods are `getOverview`, `getLessonDetail`, `getCompletion`, `getThreadContext`,
`getLexicon`, `listCandidateProjects`, `confirmFactory`, `openCoach`, `startNextLesson`,
`startSideChat` (a BB side chat of the coach thread, returning `{ coachThreadId, sideChatId }`),
`ensureSideChatTab` (puts a closed side chat tab back), `redirectFocus` and `heartbeat` (records
student activity; never an error the student sees). Every lesson in `getOverview` carries its
`coachThreadId` and outline with each Rule's `reached`; `getLessonDetail` carries `reachedRules`. Handlers fail by throwing an `Error` whose message the
student can read. When the course is missing, `getOverview` must still succeed, returning
`course: null` and `courseError`. It never throws for an unset factory project.

### Realtime

There is one channel, `REALTIME_CHANNELS.stateChanged` (`"state-changed"`), whose payload is a
`StateChangedSignal`. Frontends refetch whatever they show when it fires; the payload is a hint,
not data.

### Frontend surfaces (FRONTEND, `app/`)

| Slot (ids in `SLOT_IDS`) | Screen | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `experimental_threadList` `course-outline` | The course outline (`app/model/outline.ts`, `app/ui/Outline.tsx`): brand; one tree of every lesson (id, title, n/m and a thin bar, ✓ ● ○ status; the current one and the one on screen expanded); under it the coach thread row (or "Start with your coach", or a link to the start page), the coach thread's Rules grouped by feature with ✓ ! ○ ● glyphs, greyed and not clickable until reached, then its side chats (`↳`, "from: <Rule>") and "Ask a side question"; then Other threads | `getOverview` (coach thread, outline, `reached`), plus `experimental_useSidebarThreads` for live status, BB's side chats (hidden forks with `sourceThreadId`) and non-course threads. A Rule opens its section (`useOpenRule`); a side chat opens its coach thread after `ensureSideChatTab`. |
| `navPanel` `course` at path `course` | `""` redirects to the current lesson route or to `welcome`; `start/NNN[/<rule>]` opens the coach thread when there is one (at the Rule's section if the route names a reached Rule; once per history entry, so Back doesn't bounce), else it is the start page (the paper lesson, 6B, and "Start with your coach", which opens the new thread); `complete/NNN` is 7; `welcome` is 8 | `getLessonDetail`, `getCompletion`, `listCandidateProjects`, `confirmFactory`, `openCoach`, `startNextLesson` |
| `messageDirective` `tutor-lesson`, `tutor-progress` and `term` | The lesson card (lesson title, dek, tally, every Rule by feature with live status; reached Rules jump to their section); 3A progress cards, where `focus` is the Rule card (annotated Gherkin with live status, Examples collapsible, "Ask a side question", and the anchor `data-tutor-rule-anchor="<message.threadId>|<lesson>/<rule>"`); lexicon chips | `parseLessonRef` / `parseProgressCard` / `parseTermRef` (render nothing unvalidated; return the plain source when parsing fails), `getLessonDetail`, `getLexicon` (cache it) |
| `threadPanelAction` `rule-tab` | 2C / 4, optional and never opened by Tutor itself: the Rule in focus (or the side chat's `ruleKey`), with Back to coach, Show in the conversation and Work on this Rule next | `getThreadContext`, `getLessonDetail`, `redirectFocus` |
| `homepageSection` `continue` | 5: Continue with your coach, and the start page while there is no coach thread | `getOverview` (finds the coach thread itself; `projectId` is usually null) |
| `experimental_sidebarNavigation` `simple-nav` | BB's own navigation rows minus Plugins and Skills, activated through BB; renders BB's original while the `simpleNavigation` setting (boolean, default true) is off or loading | `useSettings` |
| content script `activity` | none: reports activity for the keep-alive (see "Where things are") | `heartbeat` |

- **Theme:** `bb.themes` contributes `paper` (`THEME_ID`; BB lists it as `plugin:tutor:paper`), a
  light and dark mapping of the workbook palette onto BB's tokens, with Archivo inlined.
  `themes/paper.css` is generated from `app/theme/paper.palette.css` by `npm run fonts`.
- **Jumping to a Rule's section** (`app/model/rule-jump.ts`, pure and tested; DOM hooks in
  `app/rule-jump.ts`): open the coach thread, then look for the anchor in the scroller holding the
  thread's timeline rows (`[data-timeline-row-id^="<thread>:"]` and their scrollable ancestor, never
  BB's hashed classes). While it is missing, scroll that timeline to its top so BB loads older
  history, until the anchor appears, the history stops growing, or 20 s pass. Then
  `scrollIntoView({ block: "start" })` and a brief highlight. Leaving the thread or scrolling by
  hand cancels it; not finding it is a toast, never an error.
- **Lost connection:** `useTutorRpc` turns a response that is not one of BB's JSON errors (for
  example the Codespaces port-forwarding proxy's empty 401) or a fetch `TypeError` into
  `ConnectionLostError` (`app/model/rpc-errors.ts`); every error surface then says the connection
  to the Codespace was lost and offers Reload, never a raw "HTTP 401".

- **CSS:** `app/paper.css` holds the fonts and tokens. Wrap plugin-owned markup in
  `.tutor-paper`. Use `.tutor-grid` for grid-paper backgrounds that may contain BB components; it
  sets nothing that inherits. `.tutor-nav` is a third root, for the simple navigation, which uses
  BB's tokens and no paper typography. Classes are `tp-*` and tokens are `--tp-*`: BB's theme uses unprefixed
  names such as `--ink`, and a bare token would leak into BB's own components. Never style BB's
  chat. Light mode only.
- **Fonts:** `app/fonts/fonts.css` is generated (`npm run fonts`), because `bb plugin build` has no
  loader for `.woff2`. A test checks that it is current.
- **Directives are leaf directives:** each one sits on its own line and renders as a block. So
  `::term` is a small chip that pops up the definition. It cannot be an inline word in a sentence
  as mocked.

### End-to-end (FEATURE)

- The credential-free provider is the spike's scripted provider, copied to
  `test/tutor/fixtures/scripted-provider/` (repo root). It opens each reply with the prompt's `::`
  lines and those of its successful tool results (so the lesson card and Rule cards lead as a coach
  writes them), and a `CALL <tool> {json}` line makes a real tool call whose JSON matches
  `toolParameterSchemas`. It forks at the tip, so BB side chats work. Real Claude Code and Codex are
  never used in tests.
- The feature's scenarios live in `test/tutor/` and follow the `test/bb/` conventions. The
  codespace entry point is `.devcontainer/tutor/devcontainer.json`: `bb`, the `claude-code`,
  `codex` and `pi` agent CLIs, and `tutor`, cloning the public tutorial repo at start-up.
  `sync-features.sh` copies every `./features/<id>` it names from `src/<id>`.

## Stubs to replace

- `server.ts`: `TODO(backend)`. It serves the fixtures over the real contract, registers the six
  tools (which refuse), and scopes `configure`.
- `app.tsx`: `TODO(frontend)`. It registers every slot with a placeholder.
- `skills/tutor/SKILL.md`: `TODO(backend)`.
