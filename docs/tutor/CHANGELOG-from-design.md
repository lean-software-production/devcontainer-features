# Changes from the approved design

This log covers the MVP build, made while the owner was away. It records every place where the
build diverges from [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) as reviewed in PR #4, and why. Entries are
newest-first.

## Decisions taken at kick-off (2026-09-25)

- **Stacked on PR #3.** The `tutor` feature depends on the unmerged `bb` feature, so this branch
  (`tutor/mvp`) is based on `bb/add-bb-standalone-devcontainer-feature`.
- **bb-app pin bumped from 0.43.3 to 0.43.4.** 0.43.4 is npm `latest` and bundles host plugin SDK
  0.5.9. The plugin compiles against that exact SDK, not npm's newer 0.5.24.
- **Tutorial repo is optional for the MVP.** The engine reads `course.yaml` when present and
  otherwise falls back to parsing the ledger table in `docs/iterations/README.md`.
  `course.yaml` and the `coach-me.md` change go to the tutorial repo as a separate PR and are not
  blocking.
- **Codespace entry point.** `.devcontainer/tutor/devcontainer.json` in this repo combines `bb`
  and `tutor`, and clones the public `tutorial` repo at start-up.
- **"Done" is proven locally**, with the `devcontainer` CLI and in CI. The final check, a real
  GitHub Codespace, is the owner's.
